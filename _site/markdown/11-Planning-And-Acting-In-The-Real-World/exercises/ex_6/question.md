In FigureÂ <a class="insideBookFigRef" target="_blank" href="https://simoncarrignon.github.io/aima-exercises/figures/jobshop-cpm-figure.png">jobshop-cpm-figure</a> we showed how to describe
actions in a scheduling problem by using separate fields for , , and .
Now suppose we wanted to combine scheduling with nondeterministic
planning, which requires nondeterministic and conditional effects.
Consider each of the three fields and explain if they should remain
separate fields, or if they should become effects of the action. Give an
example for each of the three.
